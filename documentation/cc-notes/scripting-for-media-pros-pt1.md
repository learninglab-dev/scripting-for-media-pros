## Why bother scripting?

There are loads of actions you need to do repeatedly

- Renaming files
- Transcoding files
- Backing up video
- Uploading to the cloud
- Tracking file locations
- Tracking those renaming operations
- Give editorial controls to non-editors
- Send notifications about your workflow

This tutorial series is going to look at using Javascript, specifically NodeJS, to create these automations. The main reason to use Javascript is that there is a massive community of JS coders out there that can guide you and even have already done much of the work you're looking to do already!

The other benefit to using Javascript is it will give you loads of transferrable skills that can lead you to building other sets of tools, web apps, and things like that.
